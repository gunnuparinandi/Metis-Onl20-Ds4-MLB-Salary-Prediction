## Clean Code:
* Repo and notebooks somewhat unclearly unorganized
* Generally follows PEP-8

## Good Documentation:
* Suggest further utilizing markdown cells to explain workflow
* Try to get in the habit of using docstrings

## Proper Data Science:
* Consider exploring feature engineering/selection via domain knowledge before jumping to mathematical methods
* Remember to utilize feature scaling for all linear modeling, not just LassoCV

## Comments:
* I'd suggest removing obsolete, blank or commented out cells from final notebooks
* Consider splitting data collection/cleaning and modeling into separate notebooks for clarity
